I have never owned a tablet and have always wanted one just to stream videos on Netflix, youtubes, hboGO, CinemaxOD and some light gaming like Clash of Clans. I just bought one of these used for . Am I going to hate myself for this? Did I waste my money? I just wanted a bigger platform than my LG G3 phone. The seller said it's running on 5.1.1. I've read that it's better than 5.0 but still has its flaws. What are your thoughts and opinions. Raizel or Rai referred to by some, is short for Cadis Eterama Di Raizel, the main character of the Korean manhwa Noblesse Rai possesses the title of Noblesse, which is only given to the most powerful Noble, and acts as protector of both humans and other Nobles.

so i overheard a conversation where some people that clearly only plays clash of clans talk about "phantom pain metal gear solid snake V" "have you heard about this phantom pain metal gear solid snake V game?" "oh yeah the game is good like ninja game right?" "i forgot the main character name i think it's metal gear solid snake V" (yes people, in my place they call the main character by the game name like CJ from grand theft auto they call him grand theft auto) "no it's naked snake". Please take the liberty of reading the side bar. in case you are not sure what i mean, here's the text: Many people request drawings of themselves, their dogs, their loved ones and even friends. MOST of you, that request in subreddits such as DrawMe, don't realize that the people who do the drawings, spend valuable time on something for FREE. Ok, you want a drawing of yourself with your loved one as an anniversary present, but why for free? I'll gladly spend 8 hours making an awesome portrait.

Outstanding game, fucking retarded payment model (from a player's perspective; it's a genius business model though). Does anyone know of any games that are (very) similar to this one but that you don't have to continuously pay for gems to build faster and bigger? Doesn't matter if it's a paid app or not; I actually often prefer paid apps because the quality is usually better. Also, I've already check. </p>
