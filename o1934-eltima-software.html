One cannot overestimate the importance of having a good file manager – not only for staying organized and sharing items but also for synchronizing across devices and online storage accounts. Nowadays there are a lot of options on the market – some are good at performing basic operations, while others offer more advanced functionality. Choose one carefully depending on your needs and required features. If you have to interact with iOS devices often, e.g. you need to import photos from iPhone Загрузить USB Network Gate и получить доступ к удаленным USB устройствам через Ethernet. This is a serious sticking point, makes voice chat or anything beyond mouse / controller useless (pretty much all logitech macro gear, G13, keyboards, etc.). Ian posted once long ago it was "being worked on". The only other option is ridiculously overpriced Eltima software or ZERO documentation on USB/IP with Liquidsky. If it's still way off in the distance. Is it too much to ask for a quality USB/IP tutorial?

So.I'm not entirely sure what to do from here. I'm on Windows 10 right now. My primary browser is Chrome, but I use Edge or Firefox if I absolutely have to. So here's the thing, about 2 or 4 days ago, my laptop would just suddenly not play any type of video at all from Chrome. I didn't think to check other browsers though at the time. Instead, I'd just settle for restarting my laptop, and all would be well again. Well, here we are two days down the road, and restarting does nothing. I start.

I have a surface book 2 and want to capture an Arduino device on a VM. Both host and client are running Windows 10 pro. I posted my original question in the surface forum for context: https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/a8n503/how_to_setup_hyperv_to_capture_usb_devices_on/?utm_source=reddit-android I looked up how to and it looks like only certain editions like server 2012 allow such behavior natively. Is this correct? I don't want a network based usb passthrough solution but rather.

When using one gadget from Apple for a while, a lot of users begin to change all their other devices to Apple. And no wonder, it is more convenient as the devices from one brand are perfectly synchronized. However, there are a number of things that became more complex.

For anyone who uses a FIDO U2F key to log into their Google, Facebook, Github, Dashlane, or other accounts may have noticed that the Windows Shadow desktop client doesn't properly support pass-through on some (if not all) FIDO U2F devices. I've tested the Feitian ePass key and the OnlyKey all to no avail. As companies like Google and Microsoft continue forward with their passwordless initiatives the FIDO Alliance and its U2F/FIDO2 standards are expected to take a bigger TPCast isn't plug and play but it's not insanely complicated either. When running optimally it really is indistinguishable from wired VR but there are things you should be aware of before jumping in. For example before I start a VR session I open up a WiFi analysis app on my phone and make sure my TPCast router has its own dedicated channel. I can and do notice an affect when TPCast is battling one my neighbors for bandwidth. When the router does not have its own WiFi channel tracking Hi I’m using a MacBook Pro 15” late 2011. It restarts randomly for the past few months, I tried replaced the battery and resetting SMC and it happens much less, only randomly and when I fresh-open Firefox or iMovie (but not always).

Earlier this week I made this post ( Here's an album of pics of me (KC3ASF) and /u/bondiblueos9 (N3WCC/AE) working on the repeater. ( We used information from repeater builder ( and this index had good guides, as well as PDFs of the service manuals. Finding the actual software was a little more difficult. I know this is a widespread issue, but I'm at a bit of a loss for where to look for answers. I haven't been able to connect my Note 4 to my Mac Mini since I bought it. I've been using Google Drive to transfer files to my computer, but several of the videos are too large to upload, and I need to clear space off my phone. Android File Transfer never works. I gave up on that years ago. I just tried again, since I hadn't done so since upgrading to Mac OS Sierra, but still no luck. 
So today I was bored and I decided I REALLY wanted to make a poster in The Print Shop. but how? So I got to thinking. The Apple //c (amongst others) used serial printing! First thing I did was grab a copy of RS232 Data Logger ( I fired up The Print Shop, made a poster, and hit Print. ImageWriter or Epson FX-80. I figured that more information would exist for the 9 Pin Epsons than the ImageWriter. Once I "printed" I have created a desktop application that allows: easy calculation of orbs according to user's rates party/solo exp scaling/penalties/distribution and drops with MF on map/party culler 40q recipe for very lazy ppl that dont want to do math (just enter your all gems, it will show which ones adds to 40) armour advanced calculations (dmg, armour, and other things as: fortify, arctic armour, end charge, chaos golem, etc) and more I am going to include basic author info in the program. Does anyone have any experience on how to connect 56k modems to Hyper-V machines (PCI or USB)? Or experience on this subject that can suggest a solution? This is the first task i have led, and i am having some issues! I am working on a SCADA project, we are upgrading a city wide SCADA system to a newer version of software. The original Human Machine Interface (HMI) program was Wonderware InTouch 9.5, and the alarm dialing software was Win911 (both installed on same server utilizing InTouch. </p>
