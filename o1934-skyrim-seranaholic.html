Seranaholic v1.8 Installing this mod with a mod manager is highly recommended. Update files. Overwrite your Serana (whatever version is fine). Optional files. High-res skin texture for v1.8 Main file v1.8 is required. Old files. Seranaholic v1.0.1 Seranaholic v1.2h. So after finishing Dawnguard I decided to cure Serana, only to see her eyes look unusual to say the least. Are there any mods to fix this or would I need to get one that does a whole visual overhaul of her? This will be my first time putting on a mod so any tips are welcome.

So I'm new to using mods in Skyrim, and I was loving it, until my game started crashing at every loading screen and room transition, making it impossible to play. So my question is , what mods should I remove/replace and how should I reorganize them correctly? Here is my load order: 1. Unofficial Skyrim Patch 2. Unlimited Sprinting 3 Cheat Room 4. Opening Scene Overhaul 5. Dragonborn Delayed 6. Open Civil War 7. The Parthurnax Dilemma 8. Easy Ragged Flagon Travel 9. All Thieves Guild. Is Seranaholic compatible with the SE-Version of Skyrim. Mod Organizer uses a different file structure from NMM: it installs all mods outside of the main Data folder, into its own Data folder. Skyrim reads this when it's launched with SKSE, from inside Mod Organizer. Because of this, there is less of a chance of conflict and problems are solved more easily. Serana's hair is that indistinct white color that shows up when textures aren't be loaded properly, and even re-installing BFVE Serana & Family doesn't change either her appearance or her hairstyle.
